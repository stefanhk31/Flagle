## Future Directions

This is the MVP version of this app. Features are limited to seeing a random country's flag on the screen, and guessing what country it is. The following are improvements for future versions:

v2:
- Keep a list of countries users have guessed
- Calculate the geographic distance between incorrect country guesses and the correct one, and display the distance as a hint to users

v3:
- Store randomly selected country in a cloud app that automatically changes country of the day at midnight
